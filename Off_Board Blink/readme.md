To get the off board blink project to work, the microcontroller must be programmed with the multiple blink program before being removed from the board. Then the pins of the microcontroller must be connected properly to the chip as it is placed on a breadboard. The LEDs are connected to the output pins of the chip which have low value resisters in between so the LEDs don't blow. The program is tested while the chip is on the board so the chip is not ruined. A reset circuit also must be made so the circuit will work. The reset circuit consists of a 1 nF capacitor and a 47 ohm resistor. The circuit has the resistor connected to the high voltage and one end of the capacitor while the other end of the capacitor is attached to ground. There is a wire that connects the reset circuit to the reset pin of the chip. For the 2311 microcontroller, I had to test the circuit while the microcontroller is stil attached to the board because the microcontroller cannot be removed from the board without soldering.
