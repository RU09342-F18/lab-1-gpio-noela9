In this project, we are showing that the output of Pin P1.0 is the LED D1. To demonstrate the knowledge of the use of the microcontroller, A small program is made that sets the direction of P1.0 to 0, which sets P1.0 to the output direction. Then in a while loop, P1OUT is set to be equal to the outcome of itself exclusively or'ed with 0. This is done over 5000 cycles to dispplay the LED blinking on and off. This code comes from the TI website.
