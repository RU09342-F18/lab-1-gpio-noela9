In this portion of the lab, we are using a button to control the blinking of the LEDs on the microcontroller. The coding used is very similar to that of the originall simple blink circuit, except the input is controlled by whether or not the button connected to pin 1.3 is pressed. When pressed, the LED toggles and when not pressed the LED remains idle.
