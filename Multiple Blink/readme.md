With this project, the purpose of this was to make multiple lights on the board blink at the same time at different frequencies. I may not have this work to its greatest ability, but this is the best that I was capable of getting this to work. I set P1SEL and P1SEL2 equal to itself AND'ed with the inverse of BIT0 or BIT6 to select the LEDs. I then set P1DIR equal itself OR'ed with the inverse of BIT0 and BIT6 to set P1.0 and P1.6 to the output. P1OUT is equal to itself OR'ed with BIT0 then set to itself AND'e with the inverse of bit 6 to turn the LEDs on. Since there is only one driver for the output, it was increasingly difficult to have the LEDs run simultaniously with different frequencies. So initially, the red LED (P1.6) blinks first at a slower pace, followed by the green LED (P1.0) blinking at a much faster rate.
